      "All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow\n",
      "up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old\n",
      "she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran\n",
      "with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather\n",
      "delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, âOh,\n",
      "why canât you remain like this for ever!â This was all that passed\n",
      "between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must\n",
      "grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the\n",
      "end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother was the\n",
      "chief one. She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet\n",
      "mocking mouth. Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within\n",
      "the other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover\n",
      "there is always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on\n",
      "it that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly\n",
      "conspicuous in the right-hand corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been\n",
      "boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her,\n",
      "and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who\n",
      "took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her,\n",
      "except the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and\n",
      "in time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could\n",
      "have got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a\n",
      "passion, slamming the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him\n",
      "but respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks\n",
      "and shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know,\n",
      "and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that\n",
      "would have made any woman respect him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books\n",
      "perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a\n",
      "Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped\n",
      "out, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces.\n",
      "She drew them when she should have been totting up. They were Mrs.\n",
      "Darlingâs guesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy came first, then John, then Michael.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would\n",
      "be able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was\n",
      "frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the\n",
      "edge of Mrs. Darlingâs bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses,\n",
      "while she looked at him imploringly. She wanted to risk it, come what\n",
      "might, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece\n",
      "of paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at\n",
      "the beginning again.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNow donât interrupt,â he would beg of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can\n",
      "cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and\n",
      "six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five\n",
      "naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine sevenâwho is that\n",
      "moving?âeight nine seven, dot and carry sevenâdonât speak, my ownâand\n",
      "the pound you lent to that man who came to the doorâquiet, childâdot\n",
      "and carry childâthere, youâve done it!âdid I say nine nine seven? yes,\n",
      "I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on\n",
      "nine nine seven?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOf course we can, George,â she cried. But she was prejudiced in\n",
      "Wendyâs favour, and he was really the grander character of the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "âRemember mumps,â he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went\n",
      "again. âMumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay it\n",
      "will be more like thirty shillingsâdonât speakâmeasles one five, German\n",
      "measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen sixâdonât waggle your\n",
      "fingerâwhooping-cough, say fifteen shillingsââand so on it went, and it\n",
      "added up differently each time; but at last Wendy just got through,\n",
      "with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated\n",
      "as one.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a\n",
      "narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the\n",
      "three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsomâs Kindergarten school,\n",
      "accompanied by their nurse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a\n",
      "passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had\n",
      "a nurse. As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children\n",
      "drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had\n",
      "belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. She\n",
      "had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had\n",
      "become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most\n",
      "of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by\n",
      "careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of\n",
      "to their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How\n",
      "thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one\n",
      "of her charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the\n",
      "nursery. She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have\n",
      "no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat. She\n",
      "believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf,\n",
      "and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs,\n",
      "and so on. It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the\n",
      "children to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well\n",
      "behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed. On Johnâs\n",
      "footer days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried\n",
      "an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the\n",
      "basement of Miss Fulsomâs school where the nurses wait. They sat on\n",
      "forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference.\n",
      "They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to\n",
      "themselves, and she despised their light talk. She resented visits to\n",
      "the nursery from Mrs. Darlingâs friends, but if they did come she first\n",
      "whipped off Michaelâs pinafore and put him into the one with blue\n",
      "braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at Johnâs hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr.\n",
      "Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the\n",
      "neighbours talked.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had his position in the city to consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that\n",
      "she did not admire him. âI know she admires you tremendously, George,â\n",
      "Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children\n",
      "to be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the\n",
      "only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget\n",
      "she looked in her long skirt and maidâs cap, though she had sworn, when\n",

      "\n",
      "While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come\n",
      "too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not\n",
      "alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many\n",
      "women who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of\n",
      "some mothers also. But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures\n",

      "\n",
      "The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was\n",
      "dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the\n",

      "\n",

      "should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darlingâs kiss. He was a\n",
      "lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of\n",
      "trees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his\n",

      "Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened,\n",
      "and Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang\n",
      "at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling\n",
      "screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed,\n",
      "and she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it\n",
      "was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see\n",
      "nothing but what she thought was a shooting star.\n",
      "\n",
      "She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her\n",
      "mouth, which proved to be the boyâs shadow. As he leapt at the window\n",
      "Nana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had\n",
      "not had time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.\n",

      "You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was\n",
      "quite the ordinary kind.\n",
      "\n",

      "She hung it out at the window, meaning âHe is sure to come back for it;\n",

      "children.â\n",
      "\n",
      "But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the\n",
      "window, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the\n",
      "house. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up\n",
      "winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his\n",
      "head to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him;\n",
      "besides, she knew exactly what he would say: âIt all comes of having a\n",
      "dog for a nurse.â\n",
      "\n",
      "She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a\n",

      "âNo, no,â Mr. Darling always said, âI am responsible for it all. I,\n",

      "education.\n",
      "\n",
      "They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every\n",

      "\n",

      "Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the\n",

      "\n",
      "âThat fiend!â Mr. Darling would cry, and Nanaâs bark was the echo of\n",
      "it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the\n",
      "right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.\n",
      "\n",
      "They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every\n",
      "smallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully,\n",
      "so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the\n",
      "water for Michaelâs bath and carrying him to it on her back.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI wonât go to bed,â he had shouted, like one who still believed that\n",
      "he had the last word on the subject, âI wonât, I wonât. Nana, it isnât\n",
      "six oâclock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shanât love you any more, Nana. I\n",

      "\n",
      "Michael had nearly cried. âNobody wants me,â he said, and of course the\n",
      "lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.\n",

      "\n",
      "âIt was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasnât it?â Mr. Darling\n",
      "would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for\n",
      "the party, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It\n",
      "is an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew\n",
      "about stocks and shares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the\n",
      "thing yielded to him without a contest, but there were occasions when\n",
      "it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride\n",
      "and used a made-up tie.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the\n",

      "\n",
      "âWhy, what is the matter, father dear?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âMatter!â he yelled; he really yelled. âThis tie, it will not tie.â He\n",
      "became dangerously sarcastic. âNot round my neck! Round the bed-post!\n",
      "Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my\n",
      "neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!â\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on\n",
      "sternly, âI warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my\n",
      "neck we donât go out to dinner to-night, and if I donât go out to\n",
      "dinner to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I donât go to\n",
      "the office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into\n",
      "the streets.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. âLet me try, dear,â she said, and\n",

      "cool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to\n",
      "see their fate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to\n",
      "do it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he\n",
      "thanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment\n",
      "was dancing round the room with Michael on his back.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow wildly we romped!â says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.\n",

      "\n",
      "The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr.\n",
      "Darling collided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They\n",
      "were not only new trousers, but they were the first he had ever had\n",
      "with braid on them, and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears\n",

      "when Iâm pleased with myself.â Still she would not look up, though she\n",
      "was listening eagerly. âWendy,â he continued, in a voice that no woman\n",

      "would give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did not know what she\n",
      "meant, and he held out his hand expectantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSurely you know what a kiss is?â she asked, aghast.\n",
      "\n",
      "âI shall know when you give it to me,â he replied stiffly, and not to\n",
      "hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNow,â said he, âshall I give you a kiss?â and she replied with a\n",
      "slight primness, âIf you please.â She made herself rather cheap by\n",
      "inclining her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acorn button\n",
      "into her hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had been\n",
      "before, and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain\n",
      "around her neck. It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it\n",

      "\n",
      "âAnd so,â he went on good-naturedly, âthere ought to be one fairy for\n",

      "No, stop! Everything was wrong. Nana, who had been barking\n",

      "would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing\n",

      "behind the window curtains.\n",

      "a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in\n",
      "custody of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThere, you suspicious brute,â she said, not sorry that Nana was in\n",

      "to drag herself out of Lizaâs clutches.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Liza was dense. âNo more of it, Nana,â she said sternly, pulling\n",

      "as her charges were safe? Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings,\n",
      "and Nana, seeing that no help would come from her, strained and\n",
      "strained at the chain until at last she broke it. In another moment she\n",
      "had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven,\n",
      "her most expressive way of making a communication. Mr. and Mrs. Darling\n",
      "knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery,\n",

      "âThereâs no knocker on the door,â he said.\n",

      "John and Michael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at\n",
      "the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was\n",
      "ignorance, for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up\n",
      "and down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size. Once you\n",
      "fitted, you drew in your breath at the top, and down you went at\n",
      "exactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out\n",
      "alternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the\n",

      "clothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree.\n",
      "Usually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments\n",
      "or too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only\n",
      "available tree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to you, and\n",
      "after that you fit. Once you fit, great care must be taken to go on\n",

      "whole family in perfect condition.\n",

      "buckets in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under\n",
      "the ground; especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all\n",
      "houses should do, with a floor in which you could dig if you wanted to\n",
      "go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming\n",
      "colour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in\n",
      "the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through,\n",
      "level with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two feet high,\n",
      "and then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table;\n",
      "as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus\n",
      "there was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was\n",
      "in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across\n",
      "this Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended\n",
      "her washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down\n",
      "at 6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in\n",
      "it, except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict\n",
      "rule against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned\n",
      "at once. Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have a baby,\n",
      "and he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the short and\n",
      "long of it is that he was hung up in a basket.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made\n",
      "of an underground house in the same circumstances. But there was one\n",
      "recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private\n",
      "apartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut off from the rest of the\n",
      "house by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious, always\n",
      "kept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman, however large, could\n",
      "have had a more exquisite boudoir and bed-chamber combined. The couch,\n",
      "as she always called it, was a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and\n",
      "she varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in\n",
      "season. Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there are now only\n",
      "three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust\n",
      "and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth,\n",
      "and the carpet and rugs the best (the early) period of Margery and\n",
      "Robin. There was a chandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the\n",
      "thing, but of course she lit the residence herself. Tink was very\n",
      "contemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps\n",
      "inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited,\n",
      "having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those\n",
      "rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole\n",
      "weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was\n",
      "never above ground. The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the\n",
      "pot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she\n",
      "had to keep watching that it came aboil just the same. You never\n",
      "exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe,\n",
      "it all depended upon Peterâs whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was\n",
      "part of a game, but he could not stodge just to feel stodgy, which is\n",
      "what most children like better than anything else; the next best thing\n",
      "being to talk about it. Make-believe was so real to him that during a\n",
      "meal of it you could see him getting rounder. Of course it was trying,\n",

      "their knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a\n",

      "calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them\n",
      "than on the mainland. But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry\n",
      "about her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they\n",
      "would always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave\n",
      "her complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at times was that John\n",

      "joining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table,\n",
      "writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on\n",

      "see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help\n",
      "looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic\n",
      "thing to do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his\n",

      "\n",
      "But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by\n",
      "themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we\n",

      "above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of\n",

      "dripping from the water, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim\n",
      "away, but Peter would not budge. He was tingling with life and also\n",
      "top-heavy with conceit. âAm I not a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!â he\n",
      "whispered to her, and though she thought so also, she was really glad\n",

      "\n",
      "âCaptain, is all well?â they asked timidly, but he answered with a\n",

      "her one.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âI heard nothing,â said Starkey, raising the lantern over the waters,\n",
      "and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was the nest I\n",
      "have told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was\n",
      "sitting on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSee,â said Hook in answer to Smeeâs question, âthat is a mother. What\n",
      "a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the\n",
      "mother desert her eggs? No.â\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled innocent\n",
      "days whenâbut he brushed away this weakness with his hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but\n",
      "the more suspicious Starkey said, âIf she is a mother, perhaps she is\n",
      "hanging about here to help Peter.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Hook winced. âAy,â he said, âthat is the fear that haunts me.â\n",

      "\n",
      "âIt is a princely scheme,â cried Hook, and at once it took practical\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âThere is my hand on it,â they both said.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd there is my hook. Swear.â\n",
      "\n",
      "They all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hook\n",

      "\n",
      "âWhere is the redskin?â he demanded abruptly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "no such order.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt is passing queer,â Smee said, and they all fidgeted uncomfortably.\n",

      "Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to\n",
      "pass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched the only\n",
      "thing on the lagoon. He thought it was a piece of floating paper,\n",
      "perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it would take to\n",
      "drift ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon\n",
      "the lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide,\n",

      "\n",
      "Then at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks\n",

      "shirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the\n",

      "squinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation\n",
      "must have been in his heart, but his face did not reflect it: ever a\n",

      "more; for she had always tucked them inside it, because you never know\n",
      "that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night. Then he nearly\n",
      "cried; but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed\n",
      "instead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful\n",
      "than the dreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from\n",

      "Wendyâs custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap,\n",
      "soothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer\n",
      "to put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should not\n",
      "know of the indignity to which she had subjected him. But on this\n",
      "occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm dropped\n",
      "over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part\n",
      "of his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the\n",
      "little pearls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the\n",

      "loved flowers (I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no\n",

      "\n",
      "What stayed him was Peterâs impertinent appearance as he slept. The\n",

      "may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness.\n",
      "They steeled Hookâs heart. If his rage had broken him into a hundred\n",
      "pieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt\n",
      "at the sleeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in\n",
      "darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered\n",
      "an obstacle, the door of Slightlyâs tree. It did not entirely fill the\n",
      "aperture, and he had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, he\n",
      "found to his fury that it was low down, beyond his reach. To his\n",
      "disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peterâs\n",
      "face and figure visibly increased, and he rattled the door and flung\n",
      "himself against it. Was his enemy to escape him after all?\n",
      "\n",
      "But what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peterâs\n",
      "medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was\n",
      "straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a\n",
      "dreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that\n",
      "had come into his possession. These he had boiled down into a yellow\n",
      "liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent\n",
      "poison in existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five drops of this he now added to Peterâs cup. His hand shook, but it\n",
      "was in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided\n",
      "glancing at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely\n",
      "to avoid spilling. Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim,\n",
      "and turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the tree. As he emerged\n",
      "at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole.\n",
      "Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, he wound his cloak around\n",
      "him, holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the\n",
      "night, of which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to\n",
      "himself, stole away through the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter slept on. The light guttered and went out, leaving the tenement\n",
      "in darkness; but still he slept. It must have been not less than ten\n",
      "oâclock by the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened\n",
      "by he knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his\n",
      "tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt\n",
      "for his dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.\n",

      "as the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths, she told of the\n",
      "capture of Wendy and the boys.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âIâll rescue her!â he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he leapt he\n",
      "thought of something he could do to please her. He could take his\n",

      "\n",
      "His hand closed on the fatal draught.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "âBesides,â said Peter, quite believing himself, âI never fell asleep.â\n",

      "He raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one\n",
      "of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught,\n",

      "\n",
      "His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt\n",
      "near her in distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and\n",

      "She had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which\n",
      "he had gone in search: the key that would free the children of their\n",

      "could find. First signing them to hide, Peter cut Wendyâs bonds, and\n",
      "then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off\n",
      "together; but one thing barred the way, an oath, âHook or me this\n",

      "herself with the others, and himself took her place by the mast, her\n",

      "breath and crowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the\n",

      "that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "âLads,â he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never\n",

      "\n",
      "âDown, boys, and at them!â Peterâs voice rang out; and in another\n",
      "moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the\n",
      "pirates kept together it is certain that they would have won; but the\n",
      "onset came when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and\n",
      "thither, striking wildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of\n",
      "the crew. Man to man they were the stronger; but they fought on the\n",
      "defensive only, which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose\n",
      "their quarry. Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in\n",
      "dark recesses, where they were found by Slightly, who did not fight,\n",
      "but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces, so that\n",
      "they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords\n",
      "of the other boys. There was little sound to be heard but the clang of\n",
      "weapons, an occasional screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously\n",
      "countingâfiveâsixâsevenâeightânineâtenâeleven.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who\n",
      "seemed to have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle of\n",
      "fire. They had done for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a\n",
      "match for them all. Again and again they closed upon him, and again and\n",
      "again he hewed a clear space. He had lifted up one boy with his hook,\n",
      "and was using him as a buckler, when another, who had just passed his\n",
      "sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPut up your swords, boys,â cried the newcomer, âthis man is mine.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others\n",
      "drew back and formed a ring around them.\n",
      "\n",

      "slightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "âSo, Pan,â said Hook at last, âthis is all your doing.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âAy, James Hook,â came the stern answer, âit is all my doing.â\n",

      "\n",
      "Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage\n",
      "to either blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with\n",
      "dazzling rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge\n",
      "that got past his foeâs defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill\n",
      "stead, and he could not drive the steel home. Hook, scarcely his\n",
      "inferior in brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced\n",
      "him back by the weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a\n",
      "favourite thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his\n",
      "astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then he\n",
      "sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this\n",
      "time had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging\n",
      "fiercely, pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose\n",
      "peculiar colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell\n",
      "from Hookâs hand, and he was at Peterâs mercy.\n",
      "\n",
      "âNow!â cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited\n",
      "his opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with a\n",
      "tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker\n",
      "suspicions assailed him now.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPan, who and what art thou?â he cried huskily.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIâm youth, Iâm joy,â Peter answered at a venture, âIâm a little bird\n",
      "that has broken out of the egg.â\n",
      "\n",
      "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook\n",
      "that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the\n",
      "very pinnacle of good form.\n",
      "\n",
      "âToât again,â he cried despairingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible\n",
      "sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but\n",
      "Peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of\n",
      "the danger zone. And again and again he darted in and pricked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer\n",
      "asked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form\n",
      "before it was cold forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIn two minutes,â he cried, âthe ship will be blown to pieces.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, now, he thought, true form will show.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands,\n",
      "and calmly flung it overboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "What sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he\n",
      "was, we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he\n",
      "was true to the traditions of his race. The other boys were flying\n",
      "around him now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about the deck\n",
      "striking up at them impotently, his mind was no longer with them; it\n",
      "was slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up for\n",
      "good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall. And his shoes were\n",
      "right, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his\n",
      "socks were right.\n",
      "\n",
      "James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.\n",
      "\n",
      "For we have come to his last moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger\n",
      "poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He\n",
      "did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely\n",
      "stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little\n",
      "mark of respect from us at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he\n",
      "stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through\n",
      "the air, he invited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter\n",

      "\n",
      "At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.\n",
      "\n",
      "âBad form,â he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.\n",

      "\n",

      "It need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and\n",

      "sat darning she heard a crow. Then the window blew open as of old, and\n",
      "Peter dropped in on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still\n",

      "\n",
      "He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not\n",

      "\n",
      "âHullo, Wendy,â he said, not noticing any difference, for he was\n",

      "\n",
