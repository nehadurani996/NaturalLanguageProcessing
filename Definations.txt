Why Are Regular Expressions Useful?
• Identifying whitespace between words/tokens
• Identifying/creating delimiters or end-of-line escape characters
• Removing punctuation or numbers from your text
• Cleaning HTML tags from text
• Identifying some textual patterns you're interested in


For tokenization we use two methods:
1. Findall(): Findall the words while ignoring the spaces and special characters.
2. Split(): Split the words without actually knowing the words.

\W or \w is related to words.
\S or \s is related to spaces.
